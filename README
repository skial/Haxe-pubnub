haXe client (JS) code for the pubnub service. PubNub is a massively scalable
real-time service for web and mobile games.

SERVER
------
You can publish and subscribe with neko and cpp targets. The publish method work with both js and flash,
but I've set the native haxe class to only allow the neko and cpp targets. If you want to subscribe to
channels through flash, use external interface.

CLIENT
------
Use compile.hxml to create javascript source. Then open example/client_example/subscribe/hx_sub.html
and replace <!-- Paste the url to pubnub js file --> with the code found at 
http://www.pubnub.com/account-javascript-api-include as this includes your pub_key and
sub_key. 

Then launch it.

Then do the same for example/client_example/subscribe/hx_pub.html which will
send the message 'hello skial bainn' to hx_sub.html.
